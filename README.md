### *Engineering First • Data First • Evidence First*

*"Nagpur's future deserves decisions backed by evidence—not assumptions."*

</div>

---

# 📖 Overview

NagpurLens is an open Urban Intelligence Platform that integrates fragmented urban datasets into a unified, validated, and reproducible analytical system.

Rather than building dashboards first, NagpurLens follows a **research-first and data-first engineering philosophy**, where every dataset, SQL query, analytical model, and insight is supported by documented evidence, transparent methodologies, and reproducible workflows.

The platform combines locality information, infrastructure, demographics, connectivity, accessibility, public services, and urban indicators to generate meaningful insights for citizens, planners, researchers, developers, and policymakers.

This repository documents the complete engineering lifecycle—from defining the problem to delivering urban intelligence.

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Urban information is often:

- Fragmented across multiple agencies
- Difficult to validate
- Poorly documented
- Missing relationships
- Challenging to analyze collectively
- Difficult to reproduce

Most investment, planning, and development decisions are therefore made using assumptions instead of evidence.

NagpurLens exists to solve this problem by building a transparent, reproducible Urban Intelligence Platform.

---

# ❓ Three Fundamental Questions

Every component inside this repository ultimately contributes toward answering three questions.

## 🏗️ 1. Where does infrastructure lag?

Identify underserved localities using measurable infrastructure indicators.

---

## 📈 2. Which localities demonstrate measurable urban growth?

Analyze infrastructure expansion, connectivity improvements, demographic changes, accessibility, and development patterns over time.

---

## 💰 3. Which localities demonstrate stronger long-term investment potential?

Generate transparent analytical indicators using documented methodologies and reproducible scoring models.

> **NagpurLens provides decision-support analytics, not financial advice.**

---

# 🏛️ Project Vision

NagpurLens aims to become a trusted Urban Intelligence Platform for Nagpur by creating verified datasets, transparent methodologies, and reproducible analytical workflows.

The long-term vision extends beyond a single city.

The engineering architecture is intentionally designed so that additional cities can be integrated through standardized research methodologies, reusable database structures, and scalable analytical pipelines.

# ⚙️ Engineering Philosophy

Every published insight follows the same engineering lifecycle.

# 🧩 Repository Lifecycle

Every folder represents one stage of the engineering workflow.

| Stage | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| **01 Problem** | Define objectives, users, and measurable success |
| **02 Research** | Collect evidence and document sources |
| **03 Data** | Store raw, processed, validated, and production datasets |
| **04 Quality** | Validate integrity, completeness, and reliability |
| **05 Database** | Build the analytical PostgreSQL database |
| **06 Intelligence** | Develop methodologies, models, notebooks, and findings |
| **07 Dashboard** | Present insights through interactive applications |

# 📊 Core Urban Datasets

The initial platform focuses on building high-quality foundational datasets.

- Locality Master Dataset
- Infrastructure Dataset
- Demographic Dataset
- Geographic Reference Dataset
- Connectivity Dataset
- Accessibility Dataset
- Urban Indicators Dataset

Every production dataset includes:

- Source attribution
- Collection methodology
- Version history
- Validation status
- Geographic verification
- Data dictionary
- Quality score

---

# 🛡 Data Quality Principles

Data quality is treated as a first-class engineering objective.

Each production dataset is evaluated for:

- Source traceability
- Coordinate validation
- Referential integrity
- Duplicate detection
- Missing value assessment
- Schema validation
- Join validation
- Documentation completeness
- Reproducibility

Datasets are promoted to production only after passing documented quality standards.

---

# 🗄 Database Engineering

NagpurLens uses PostgreSQL as its analytical foundation.

The database layer focuses on:

- Normalized schema design
- Referential integrity
- Constraints
- Seed datasets
- Analytical SQL
- Business queries
- Urban indicators

The database is designed for reproducibility rather than one-time analysis.

---

# 🧠 Urban Intelligence

Urban Intelligence transforms validated datasets into actionable insights.
